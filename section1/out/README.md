# Expected results

Please put the artefacts from Section 1 here:  
  
* Curated dataset with labels, as collection of NIFTI files. Amount of training image volumes should be the same as the amount of label volumes
* A Python Notebook with the results of your Exploratory Data Analysis. If you prefer to do it in raw Python file, that is also acceptable - in that case put the `.py` file there, making sure that you copy Task descriptions from the notebook into your comments.
