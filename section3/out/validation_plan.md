# Validation Plan

## What is the intended use of the product?

The use of the product is to quickly identify the hippocampus volume , posterior and anterior and assist the doctors.

## How was the training data collected?

The training data was collected from various different subjects using MRI.

## How did you label your training data?

The data was labeled manually by humans.


## How was the training performance of the algorithm measured and how is the real-world performance going to be estimated?

The performance was measured using the Jaccard distance and dice distance from the labels. Î¤he real-world performance will be measured when doctors use the system in a controled environment. 


## What data will the algorithm perform well in the real world and what data it might not perform well on?

The data will perform well in reasonable images of human brains with a clear view of the hippocambus. If the hippocambus isn't clear the algorithm will not perform well.
